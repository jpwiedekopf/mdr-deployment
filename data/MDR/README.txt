MDR Exports
-----------

This directory contains various MDR exports, that document the
incorporation of EJP-RD attributes into the GBA biobank data
model.

I aim to ensure that the file "export-mdr-mdr16-ejprd.xml" always
contains the most up-to-date version of the data model.

export-mdr-gba-mdr11.xml	Original mdr16 export, made by Noemi
export-mdr-mdr16-orpha.xml	Contains Orpha code and a boolean "has family member"
export-mdr-mdr16-ejprd.2.xml	Second export of Namespace with Orpha code and family member element group, with auto-generated version nums
export-mdr-mdr16-ejprd.3.xml	Third export of Namespace with Orpha code and family member element group, with manually-corrected version nums
export-mdr-mdr16-ejprd.4.xml	Last export before flattening FamilyMember elemnt group
export-mdr-mdr16-ejprd.5.xml	First export after flattening FamilyMember elemnt group, with corrected FamilyMember version
export-mdr-mdr16-ejprd.6.xml
export-mdr-mdr16-ejprd.7.xml
export-mdr-mdr16-ejprd.100.xml	Removed FamilyMemeber and replaced with "Rare Disease", to align with new GUI.
